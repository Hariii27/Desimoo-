## Introduction

India’s native cows are more than animals—they are symbols of cultural heritage, sustainable agriculture, and ecological stability. However, modern market pressures have led to the gradual disappearance of these breeds. Desimoo was conceived as a digital-first initiative to address this growing concern by building a comprehensive, accessible, and scalable ecosystem to support and promote native cow-based livelihoods.

---

## Problem Statement

Farmers in rural India are increasingly abandoning native cow breeds due to:

- Lower market prices and limited customer reach for native cow products
- High costs and inconsistent availability of quality cattle feed
- Absence of timely veterinary support and healthcare infrastructure
- Lack of awareness and accessibility to government schemes and subsidies
- Exploitation in cattle trade due to unregulated marketplaces

These challenges contribute to the decline of native breeds, risking biodiversity, food quality, and traditional livelihoods.

It is designed to empower farmers financially while conserving heritage breeds.
